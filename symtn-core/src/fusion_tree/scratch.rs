//! Caller-owned scratch for one-tree-at-a-time fusion-tree paths (#2192).
//!
//! TensorKit's `FusionTree` is isbits, so its Unique `permute` and `split`
//! (`_trace_permute!(::UniqueFusion)`, `src/tensors/tensoroperations.jl:242`)
//! build every intermediate tree on the stack. A symtn key owns an arena, so
//! building one per intermediate tree cost several allocations per term. These
//! scratches hold the trees a path builds and reads back without keeping
//! them; the caller owns one per call and reuses it for every tree, so once it
//! has held its widest tree the path allocates nothing per tree.
