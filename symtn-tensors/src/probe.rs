//! Test probes of symtn-tensors (#2221): one thread-local ledger of
//! [`Event`] counts, read as a window through [`record`] or consumed
//! through [`take`], plus the armed hooks that run inside production code.
//!
//! Every count is per thread, so concurrent tests do not move each other's.
//! Process-global statistics (`StructureCache` hits and misses, the reset
//! epoch), the cache test lock and public profiling types are not probes
//! and stay with their owners. Fixtures that count calls into a test's own
//! callback live in the test that supplies the callback.
