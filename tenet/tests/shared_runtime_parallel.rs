//! Standalone ops on a SHARED `Runtime` must be correct and deterministic when
//! driven from many threads at once (#155): each op now leases a per-rule
//! execution context (and, for factorizations, a dense executor) from a pool
//! instead of holding the coarse runtime lock, so this exercises that the
//! pooled machinery never leaks state across concurrent ops.
//!
//! Determinism: every thread runs the SAME deterministic computation on its own
//! seeded operands, so every result must be BIT-identical to the single-threaded
//! reference (a leased context that carried torn state from another thread would
//! change the value or panic). This is the concurrency guard behind the
//! "recoupling_threads=1-vs-N" determinism promise, which the lease change does
//! not otherwise touch (the recoupling worker count rides through `for_config`
//! into every leased context unchanged).
