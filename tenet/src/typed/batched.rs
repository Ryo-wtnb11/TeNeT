//! Structure signatures: the key under which tensors can share one prepared
//! plan and one stacked payload layout (#1287).
//!
//! Neither TensorKit nor QSpace has a batched path, so the signature is
//! defined by what TeNeT's eager operations read from an operand: the rule
//! authority, the logical hom space, the fusion-tree block structure, the
//! payload placement and the Runtime. The payload dtype is the type parameter
//! `D` of every consumer and is therefore checked by the compiler, not here.
//!
//! # Failure rule of every batched plan
//!
//! [`ComposePlan`], [`ContractPlan`] and [`EighFullPlan`] (Host and CUDA)
//! share one rule. A workspace created by another plan is rejected before it
//! is touched. Otherwise a failed `execute` or `execute_into` (a validation
//! error, a signature mismatch or a backend error) leaves no observable
//! workspace output: `take_output` returns `None` until the next successful
//! `execute`, which rewrites every member. The failed call's buffers stay in
//! the workspace and are reused, so the next call allocates no more than a
//! warm one. After a failed `execute_into` the caller's destination contents
//! are unspecified; a validation error never writes them.
