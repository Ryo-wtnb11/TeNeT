///   solver may differ from the eager one in the last ULPs, so results are
///   deterministic for a fixed `B` but not bit-stable across `B`. At `B = 1`
///   the solver and host code are the eager ones.
/// - **Host**: after the whole batch is admitted, each member runs eager's
///   per-sector solver stage, gauge-fixed exactly as Host eager (the
