//! The one counting allocator for allocation-budget tests and probes.
//!
//! Test and example targets include this file with
//! `#[path = ".../tests/support/counting_alloc.rs"] mod counting_alloc;` and
//! install it with one line:
//! `#[global_allocator] static ALLOCATOR: counting_alloc::CountingAllocator = counting_alloc::CountingAllocator;`
//!
//! Counters are thread-local: a measurement sees only the allocations its own
//! thread makes. Why not process-global counters: a test running concurrently
//! in the same binary allocates inside the measured window and breaks the
//! budget (#1824). Budgets that also depend on process-global caches take
//! [`serial`] as well.
//!
//! A consequence: with a multi-threaded runtime (for example
//! `transform_owned_parallel`, the CUDA tests, or the default row of the
//! `eager_overhead_ledger` example) a measurement gates only the calling
//! thread's allocations, not those made on worker threads.
