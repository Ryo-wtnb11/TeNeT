//! Test probes of symtn-operations (#2221): one thread-local ledger of
//! [`Event`] counts, consumed through [`take`], plus the armed write
//! bitmaps of the owned writers.
//!
//! The ledger exists under the `testing` feature because symtn-tensors tests
//! read the two public takers; the bitmaps are this crate's own tests.
//! Process-global observation (`host_pool`'s pool observations) is not a
//! probe and stays with its owner.
