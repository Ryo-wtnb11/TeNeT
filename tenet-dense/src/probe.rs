//!
//! The always-compiled `cuda_transfer_stats` and the Tenferro session
//! counters are public observability, not probes, and stay with their
//! owners. `CudaFullDownloadBytes` is the part of `d2h_bytes` that went
//! through `CudaDenseStorage::download`, `CudaMetadataDownloadBytes` the
//! part that went through `cuda_download`; the two are not one event.

// Without the `cuda` feature no event is recorded; the CPU-only builds use
// the buffer log alone.
