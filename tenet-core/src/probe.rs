//! Test probes of tenet-core (#2221): one thread-local ledger of [`Event`]
//! counts, read through [`record`], and the one reset-hook slot.
//!
//! Process-global statistics (`StructureCache` hits and misses, the reset
//! epoch) are not probes and stay with their owners. The composer step
//! counts are the one measurement a sibling crate reads, so they stay
//! available under the `testing` feature.
